## Overview

This repository contains Python-based simulations for cognitive neuroscience experiments using OpenSesame. The simulations are designed to support Dr. Jamshed Bharucha's research endeavors investigating the impact of music on human brain function. Synthesised audio stimuli are created using PyAudio to conduct experiments related to music perception and cognition.

## Features

- Python-based simulations for cognitive neuroscience experiments
- Integration with OpenSesame for experimental design and data collection
- Generation of synthesised audio stimuli using PyAudio
- Support for research investigations into the impact of music on human brain function

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12.2
- OpenSesame
- PyAudio

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cognitive-neuroscience-experiments.git
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the experiments in OpenSesame and configure experimental settings as needed.
2. Run the experiments to collect data and analyze the results.
3. Use PyAudio to generate synthesised audio stimuli for experimental trials.
